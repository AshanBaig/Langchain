On fields of green where dreams ignite,
The players stand, bat held tight.
The bowler steams with fierce intent,
A ball is flung, the air is bent.

Crowds arise with each bold stroke,
Cheers and whistles loudly broke.
From slips to covers, fielders dive,
In search of catches, hands alive.

The pitch becomes a battleground,
Where leather meets the wooden sound.
The batsmen dance with nimble feet,
Playing shots both soft and sweet.

The spinner loops with cunning guile,
He waits to trap with drift and style.
The batsman lunges, forward pressed,
A faint edge leaves him unimpressed.

Sixes fly beyond the rope,
And fans erupt with every hope.
The ball ascends to kiss the sky,
While fielders watch it sailing by.

The umpire lifts a steady hand,
Signals wide or out on stand.
A finger raised breaks every heart,
As batters make their lonely start.

Partnerships build with care and grace,
Running between with hurried pace.
Singles, twos, and boundaries flow,
As scoreboard numbers upward grow.

The keeper crouches, gloves on call,
To catch the faintest nick of all.
The stumps await with bails on edge,
A direct hit—a run-out pledge.

The crowd in waves of flags and song,
Chant their heroes all day long.
Painted faces, hearts ablaze,
Living moments in a cricket craze.

From Karachi streets to Delhi lanes,
From Lahore’s grounds to Eden Plains.
Children swing with wooden stick,
Dreaming big with each ball flick.

The drinks break comes, the sun still burns,
The players wait for next returns.
Strategies shift, plans redraw,
For cricket is a game of law.

A yorker hits with crushing might,
The stumps collapse, what a sight!
The batsman bows, the fielders cheer,
Another wicket gone, it’s clear.

The commentator screams with flair,
Describing plays with voice laid bare.
Replays show the magic done,
As fans rewind each precious run.

The final overs, tension peaks,
The chasing side, their fortune seeks.
Fielders crowd the batter's space,
Hoping for a winning chase.

The bowler wipes his sweaty brow,
Runs in again, delivers now.
A lofted drive, the ball takes flight,
Will it be caught? Or gone from sight?

The boundary’s met, the crowd erupts,
Opponents sink, their spirits slumped.
The scoreboard clicks, the target's near,
Victory calls, the fans all cheer.

A single run, the scores are tied,
Last ball remains, eyes open wide.
The bowler runs, the batter swings,
A four is struck, and joy it brings!
